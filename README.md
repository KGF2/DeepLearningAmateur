Hello,

I'm Kushal Kumar Jujare, a Master in Science student in Nanoelectronic Systems at Technical University of Dresden, Germany.
I'm currently pursuing Master thesis in the Department of 'Concept, Digital design and Verification', at Infineon Technologies AG, Munich.
I have worked as a VLSI design/verification engineer with almost 5 years of work experience in SanDisk India.
Also, I have worked as a student and have done internships throughout my masters studies. 

I have always been curious to explore machine learning since my undergraduate, but most of the applications were in Image processing which didn't excite me at that time. Fast forward after some years, I could see ML penetrating into many fields. Ranging from Stock markets, Pharmaceuticals, Automotive vehicles, Robitics and eventually to VLSI. I also realised that I was very narrow minded when exploring ML's applications during my undergraduate. 

So I would say this is my second innings with Machine learning and this time, it is explore ML's potential applications in the VLSI digital front-end. I have come across limited papers with ML applications in back-end CAD tools, some Linting and Formal tools. But i forsee treamendous applications in front-end digital design and verification as well. The way automation has become inevitable in digital front-end now-a-days, ML algorithms would also become imminent in near future to keep up with the demand.

All these take me towards starting an exciting journey to deep dive into ML, DL, GAN, RL concepts. Together with my Digital domain knowledge and experience, I'm sure that this crossover will take me towards some amazing applications. If not anything, I would have explored this incredible field of ML.  

Let the journey begin!
